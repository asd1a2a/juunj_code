			<h3>Detournement d'un Classique / Diversion of Classic</h3>
			<span>
				Juun.J graduated from ESMOD Seoul in 1992 and worked at many prestigious fashion houses before creating his own label "Lone Costume" in 1999. Not long after showing at Seoul Fashion
				Week, Lone Costume became the most sought after brand with a cult following. Asia Times selected Juun.J as the top 4 notable designers to watch. In 2007, with the world as his stage
				Juun.J debuts his namesake label during Paris Men¡¯s Fashion Week to great acclaim. By deconstructing traditional ideas in menswear, Juun.J quickly establishes himself as the most
				innovative designer to watch during fashion week. The year 2012 marks another momentous year for Juun.J as he becomes part of Cheil Industries to truly become global and meet the
				demands of his following. Juun.J's decidedly modern approach to design is deeply rooted in his masterly knowledge in classic tailoring where he shatters old notions to create new
				silhouettes. Largely inspired by youth and street culture Juun.J aptly calls this 'Street Tailoring'. His avant design and classicism with his precise tailoring will no doubt continue
				to be a tour de force in the evolution of menswear.
